# Safe-Reinforcement-Learning-using-Symbolic-Logical-Programming-for-Autonomous-Highway-Driving

## Abstract

The rapidly changing driving environments and the presence of other road users make decision-making in
autonomous highway driving a challenging problem. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been a popular approach to
address this problem, but current DRL solutions are limited to simulation environments due to safety concerns, making their
transfer to the real environment a challenge. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a novel safe DRL framework that
combines the benefits of symbolic logical programming (SLP) and DRL for safe learning during real-time interaction in a real
environment. The proposed method provides a novel solution to obtain autonomous driving policies that can be trained through
interaction with real envirounment while the safety is assured. We have implemented the proposed method on the highD dataset
and proved that with our method, the agent did not involve in unsafe actions in both the training and test scenarios. Moreover,
we have shown that the method outperformed the DRL agent without SLP.
